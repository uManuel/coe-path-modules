# Introduction

This is a course of advanced patterns in react in which we're going to use the medium clap to test it out what we learnt.

## The structure

We have the folder

1. `finished` -> the code that is finished we're going to check it if we have some hindrances in our process of learning.
2. `clean-slate` -> the code that I'm going to write through the course.
3. `clean-slate/showcase/src/patterns/` there are all the patterns that we're going to build in the course.

### Animation and styling

To use animation we have used mo-js and we gave them styling.

we have 3 different components in which we're going to add styling and animation

1. ClapIcon
2. ClapCount
3. CountTotal

## Custom Hooks: The first foundational pattern

- Only call hooks at the top level.
- Only call hooks from react functions.
- Don't call hooks in loops, conditions or nested functions.
