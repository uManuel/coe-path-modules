# Introduction

This is a course of advanced patterns in react in which we're going to use the medium clap to test it out what we learnt.

## The structure

We have the folder

1. `finished` -> the code that is finished we're going to check it if we have some hindrances in our process of learning.
2. `clean-slate` -> the code that I'm going to write through the course.
